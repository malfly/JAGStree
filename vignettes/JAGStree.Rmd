## Introduction
In many real-world applications, individuals or subjects may appear in multiple data sets, setting the stage for the opportunity to synthesize evidence to use all available data for inference. These relational structure of these data sources often admits a graphical representation, where nodes may be represented by data sources and edges representing the relationship between them (e.g., directed edges for subgroupings or representation of time).  One such representation is as a tree (i.e., an acyclical graph with directed edges). Performing inference on this structure can be achieved using MCMC methods to obtain estimates of posterior distributions of a Bayesian hierarchical model.

This package is geared towards one subset of cases in which this general framework holds [@flynncomp].


## makeJAGStree()

In particular, we assume a number of related data sources exist with a known relational structure described by a tree. We also assume that nodes are associated with integer counts, which are multinomially distributed from the parent node, and branches are associated with a probability, which are Dirichlet distributed among a given sibling group.  Then, given a dataframe representing the tree structure, the `makeJAGStree()` function will generate appropriate MCMC modelling code to be used with JAGS, to run a Bayesian hierarchical model.

The data frame must contain only two columns:

- *'from'* (string, node label)

- *'to'* (string, node label)

The '*from*' and '*to*' labels encode the tree structure, describing the directed edge between nodes.

This `makeJAGStree` function has three parameters, two of which are required and one which is optional:

- `data`: This required argument must be a data frame with at least two columns: *from* and *to*.  Together, these columns specify the tree structure.  Other columns may also be included; the `AutoWMM` package can additionally be used to render tree diagrams and perform root node population size estimation with the weighted multiplier method, if appropriate [@flynnmethods, @flynnapplication]

- `prior`: This optional argument specifies the prior chosen for the root node population size.  The default is `lognormal`, while a `uniform` prior is also an option.

- `filename`: This required argument is used to name the JAGS code output file.  It must end in `.mod` or `.txt` for correct functionality.

The Bayesian model implied behind this JAGS code is described at length elsewhere [@flynncomp], and is based on previously developed methodology [@flynnmethods].  A more extensive application to real-world data can be found in [@flynnapplication].

### Examples
The functionality of the package is best demonstrated using simple trees.  The `AutoWMM` package can also be used to help render and visualize each of these trees:
```{r, example}
data <- data.frame("from" = c("Z", "Z", "A", "A"),
                       "to" = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                       "Estimate" = c(4, 34, 9, 1),
                       "Total" = c(11, 70, 10, 10),
                       "Count" = c(NA, 500, NA, 50),
                       "Population" = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
                       "Description" = c("First child of the root", "Second child of the root",
                                         "First grandchild", "Second grandchild"))

# optional use of the AutoWMM package to show tree structure
Sys.setenv("RGL_USE_NULL" = TRUE)
library(AutoWMM)
library(DiagrammeR)
tree <- makeTree(data)
drawTree(tree)
```

The function can be directly applied to the data, and will produce a `.mod` or `.txt` file, depending on which is specified.  A uniform prior can also be chosen for the root node, with parameters that will be specified when running JAGS:
```{r eval=FALSE }
makeJAGStree(data1, filename="data1_JAGSscript.mod")
makeJAGStree(data1, filename="data1_JAGSscript.txt", prior="uniform")
```
