## Submission summary

This is the first submission of my package to CRAN.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## R-hub checks

I could not test using R-hub checks due to the following error:
- Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
  SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK: [builder.r-hub.io] SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate

The error persists when trying to use rhub::validate_email() directly.

## win-builder checks

No issues were found.

## Special notes

None to report.
