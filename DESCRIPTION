Description: When relationships between sources of data can be represented by a tree, the generation of appropriate Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling code to be used with 'JAGS' to run a Bayesian hierarchical model can be automatically generated by this package. Any admissible tree-structured data can be used, under the assumption that node counts are multinomial and branching probabilities are Dirichlet among sibling groups. The methodological basis used to create this package can be found in Flynn (2023) <http://hdl.handle.net/2429/86174>.
